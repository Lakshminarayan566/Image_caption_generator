# Image_caption_generator
An offline-capable image captioning system using the BLIP Vision-Language Transformer. It takes any image as input and generates natural language descriptions using a ViT encoder and language decoder, built with PyTorch and HuggingFace — model weights download once, then run without any API calls.
